## Description 
This application is a fitness tracker. It allows users to start or continue a workout and enter different exercises for that workout. It also allows users to review stats on the last 7 workouts completed. 
This can help users track their progress on the go.

## Lessons Learned
In buidling this application I became more familiar with mongoDB and mongoose. Specifically creating models, queries, and aggregating data.
